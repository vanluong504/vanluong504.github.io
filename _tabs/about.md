My name is Van Luong, also know under my nickname **vanluongkma**

A student and a CTF player who interested in Cryptography. Seeking an internship opportunity in SOC â€“ Security Operation Center
 
I learning Cyber Security at the [**VietNam Academy of Cryptography Techniques**](https://actvn.edu.vn/) for the 2022-2026 school year (course 19). 
 
In my opinion, if you want to learn Cryptography, you must have a strong enough background in Mathematics and Computer Science. 
 
Math is the premise theory, and Computer Science is where Cryptography is applied.

I regularly write articles on [**hackmd**](https://hackmd.io/@vanluongkma)
